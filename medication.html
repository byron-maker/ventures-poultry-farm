        <h1>Traditional herbal preparations for indigenous poultry health management in Kenya</h1>

        
        <div style="text-align:justify ;">
            <P><b>Abstract</P></b>
Conventional disease prevention methods are geared towards birds in confinement and not free range in an indigenous poultry production system. However, the existing indigenous technical knowledge inherited from past generations has sustained the local poultry production system. This knowledge is passed on verbally and is hardly documented. The study reportedly collected information on traditional preparations (e.g herbs) in Kimilili and South Wanga of Bungoma and Butere/Mumias districts respectively. Its objective being to document existing plant material (herbs) and any other traditional preparations used for poultry health management in rural poultry production systems.

The study confirmed the existence of vast local knowledge for indigenous poultry health management. The preparations are usually more than one-plant parts whose amounts are not specific. They usually target symptoms of diseases, which were encoded into specific diseases. Aloe Vera, pepper, sisal and neem were the most used medicinal plants. Parts used included leaves, barks, and roots. Some specific concoctions were said to prevent or treat specific diseases. For example Aloe Vera was said to treat Newcastle, Croton megalocarpus was said to treat coryza sinusitis, Combretum mole was said to treat intestinal worms.

Key words: Herbs, poultry health management

<p><b>Introduction</p></b>

Diseases are the main constraints of indigenous poultry production in western Kenya; where Indigenous poultry farming is an integral part of mixed farming. The birds are raised mostly on low input extensive free-range system of production. Farmers usually have to start with new flock after heavy losses incurred due to disease outbreaks. The existing conventional disease control programs favor the high investment intensive systems of production with birds in confinement and not small-scale farmers with less than 100 birds.

Due to high cost of conventional medicines and vaccines coupled with the lack of knowledge on their use, these drugs are usually out of reach of the small-scale farmers. There is therefore need for cheap easy to use and sustainable local poultry disease control programs.

Since ancient times, plants and plant parts have an indispensable source of medicine for indigenous poultry production systems. Although modern medical science has developed to a great extent, many farmers in western Kenya depend on plant parts and herbal remedies for indigenous poultry health management. Unfortunately, local medical traditions are being lost because they are communicated orally from generation to generation and are largely undocumented. Very little has been done to verify and validate information gathered.

The study reportedly collected information on traditional preparations (e.g herbs) with the objective of documenting existing plant material (herbs) and any other traditional preparations used for poultry health management in rural poultry production systems.
 
<p><b>Materials and methods</p></b>

An ethno botanical survey was conducted in Kimilili and South Wanga divisions of Bungoma and Butere/Mumias districts respectively. Indigenous knowledge (ITK) on medicinal herbs and trees used for poultry health management was documented after interviews, observations and group discussions with herbalists, farmers and other stakeholders.

A check list used to collect information sought indigenous knowledge on common diseases or selection of disease symptoms and pests of local poultry, the clinical signs of the diseases, plants and plant parts used for prevention or treatment, local names of concoctions, parts used for each ingredient, preparation of concoction and administration of the concoctions.

The ITKs were ranked based on frequencies from the number of times each herb, plant or plant part was mentioned in all interviews.

During group discussions, symptoms described by farmers, herbalists were encoded into suspected diseases by subject matter specialists (SMS- Veterinary officers) and other stakeholders. Diseases/symptoms targeted by herbs, plant parts were encoded into possible target diseases by SMS's

The extracts from approximately 14 different traditional medicines were prepared to investigate the antimicrobial activities against poultry disease-related bacteria. Extracts were obtained using water and methanol extraction methods (Watai  2003). Bacteria used for testing were commercial stocks of Escherichia coli (gramme negative rod); Staphylococcus aureus (gramme positive cocci) and Salmonella tymphi.

Wells were made in nutrient broth (Agar) in petri dishes. Extracts were then dropped into wells. Bacteria were then grown at 370c for 24 hours. Inhibition was determined by bacterial growth closer/away from wells with extracts

    The major indigenous poultry diseases.
The second common disease problem mentioned by farmers was described symptomatically as a one with noisy breathing and coughing accompanied with nasal discharge and watery eyes. This was interpreted as chronic respiratory disease.

Warts on the naked parts of the comb and wattle were cited and interpreted as fowl pox.

Sharp coughs, sneezing and gasps culminating in difficulty in breathing especially among young birds were interpreted to be Infectious bronchitis.

Chickens with swollen heads were interpreted to suffer from infectious coryza. Bloody diarrhoea was interpreted to be coccidiosis.

Parasites among them lice, mites and fleas were cited but ranked low because farmers did not realize many losses due to these problems.

The amounts of ingredients used in concoctions were not specific although in most instances a 1 kg tin of water was used as a measure for daily administration. Birds were usually given the concoction to drink throughout the day with fresh concoction is provided daily.

Specific concoctions were prepared for specific diseases. For example Aloe Vera was said to prevent Newcastle, Croton megalocarpus was said to treat coryza sinusitis, combretum mole was said to treat intestinal worms.

Other concoctions were prepared for general ailments classified into gastrointestinal diseases, respiratory diseases, cutaneous diseases and parasitic diseases. For example Pepper (capsicum), Khasanda kwata, imbululusi concoctions were prepared for control and treatment of respiratory diseases, Sisal (Likonge), Omusirangokho, tithonia concoctions were prepared for gastrointestinal ailments, neem (azadirachta indica ) was known to prevent viral ailments.

Farmers used repellants such as Mexican marigold Tegetes minuta and tephrosia vogelia as insect repellants in poultry houses. Other times they were used in treatment against mites.


<p><b>Discussion</p></b>

Although the common belief was that traditional medicine was a secret divulged only to a few, most respondents were open and willing to share information. The information was later discussed in group discussions during the group meetings with farmers.

The most common poultry disease was NCD. This was because the use of conventional vaccines in indigenous chicken production was limited by cost, dose format and lack of thermostability. Because of these reasons rural scavenging chickens were rarely vaccinated and flocks remained highly susceptible to NCD with periodic decimation and economic losses. Other diseases were also rarely controlled. Farmers therefore always had to start with new flocks following outbreaks of diseases (Okitoi et al 2000).

The finding that Aloe spp was the most commonly used herb in rural poultry management was in agreement with a report by Mwale et al (2005) and Grindlay and Reynolds (1986) that it was used in management of a variety of diseases and that Aloe acted as abroad spectrum remedy (Ibrahim et al 1984) in rural poultry health management.

Farmers usually sought plant and plant parts to use in the management of their flocks after a disease outbreak. More often it was symptomatic treatment.

Most farmers tended to use more than one ingredient in concoctions to make the concoction as broad as possible. This is due to the fact that clinical symptoms of many poultry diseases were so closely related that sometimes it was difficult to distinguish between specific diseases. Some clinical symptoms were regarded as diseases themselves and sometimes some local names given to some diseases were based on symptoms. This broad-spectrum approach was similar to the current conventional medicine approach with broad-spectrum antibiotic.

The survey revealed that little planting of medicinal plants was carried out for any of the species. Rather, communities normally relied on supply from the wild. Where farmers had cultivated medicinal plants, they had gotten seedlings from local government or project nurseries. For example the neem tree was only found where the nurseries had been established by projects.

<p><b>Preparation of concoctions</p></b>
    Control and treatment of poultry diseases was based on concoctions of plant materials. More than one plant part (leaves, barks, roots and tubers) was used in concoctions. The amounts of each ingredient were not known and in most cases were offered in drinking water. Preparations were done by pounding mixtures of the ingredients, adding water, mixing well and allowing it to settle before administration.

Farmers recognized the existence of sexes of plants. This knowledge is used in preparing concoctions. For example preparations involving pawpaw (lipaipai) roots, only male plants are used. Some times the preparations are used in form of paste, for example in the treatment of scaly mites, neem (Mwarubaini) mixed with omushivano (residue from soaked and filtered ash) and a little water is made into paste and smeared on the scaly legs.
 <p><b>Conclusions</p></b>
 Small-scale indigenous poultry farmers treasure an intimate indigenous knowledge inherited from past generations to sustain the low input extensive free-range system.

The wild was the main source of medicinal plants used for medical remedies in an indigenous poultry production system. There was no organized scientific cultivation of medicinal plants

Respondents had no doubt about the potency of the herbal preparations. But there is no scientific evidence to back this. The fact that more than one plant or plant part is used in the concoctions tells the broad spectrum approach farmers use.

In conclusion, these findings suggest that herbal extracts may play important roles for antimicrobial activities against poultry disease-related bacteria

<p><b>Recommendations from the survey</p></b>
Priority plants identified should be promoted for planting by farmers

Farmers be trained and demonstrated on the advantages of cultivating indigenous plants and integrating medicinal plants into existing farming systems.

Research is needed on the agronomic requirements of these plants. There is need to incorporate such species in an agro forestry system.

<p><b>COMMON CHICKEN DISEASES</p></b>
Many chicken diseases mimic one another. Often it is impossible to tell exactly why a chicken is sick until it is too late. Fortunately there are a variety of natural remedies that will help a chicken recover from a wide variety of illnesses. Let’s start by taking a quick look at the 10 most common chicken diseases:
<ol>

</ol> 
<div style="text-align:left ;">
<li>Diarrhoea – Characterized by white or green loose droppings, diarrhea is caused by cold, dampness or unsanitary housing or feed.</li>
<li>External Parasites – Mites, lice and even ticks can plague chickens and cause their production to drop. A sure sign you have chicken mites: the scales on the chicken’s legs stand up.</li>
<li>Internal Parasites – A parasite overload can cause poor health and even death. Coccidiosis is the most common parasite problem in young chicks.</li>
    <li>Marek’s Disease – This is a generic term for a variety of respiratory viruses that affect chickens. A bird with a weak immune system is especially prone to this chicken disease.</li>
        <li>Rickets – This chicken disease is the result of poor nutrition, specifically calcium deficiency.. The bones are weak and cannot support the body weight of the bird.</li>
            <li>Vitamin A Deficiency – This nutritional problem mimics respiratory illness. Typically the distinction cannot be made until the sick chicken has died.</li>
                <li>Fowl Cholera – Susceptible birds can catch this deadly chicken disease from wild animals. Acute cases show no symptoms but sudden death.</li>
                    <li>Gapes – A sick chicken with a gapeworm infestation makes a characteristic gasping sound. Untreated, a severe infestation is fatal.</li>
                        <li>Fowl Pox – A viral chicken disease, fowl pox causes raised lesions on the comb, wattle and in the throat of affected birds.</li>
                            <li>Exotic Chicken Diseases – Any bird with a weak immune system is susceptible to various types of flus and avian diseases which cause depression, decrease production and damage the nervous system.</li>
</div>
                                <p><b>NATURAL TREATMENTS FOR CHICKEN DISEASES</p></b>
While parasites can be treated with chemical de-wormers and chemical sprays, <br>most of these common chicken health problems are difficult to treat medically. <br>The best option is to support a healthy immune system in all of your chickens. This helps prevent disease, and helps the birds fight illness when they are infected.

<p><b>NATURAL REMEDIES FOR CHICKENS</p></b>

<ul>
    <div style="text-align: justify;">
<li>1. Black Pepper</li>
Black pepper contains a lot of vitamins and nutrients. It also functions as an anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antioxidant. 
In addition, it helps flush toxins and absorb nutrients from its food sources. Chickens are prone to respiratory problems. 
Adding a few pinches of black pepper to their feed or in their water can help prevent respiratory problems and ease coughing.
<li>2. Cayenne Pepper</li>
For many years, farmers normally add pepper to chicken and duck feed or water to boost egg production. 
Worm diseases are known to hamper the flock’s ability to reproduce in which cayenne pepper is a very effective remedy. 
Cayenne pepper burns parasites that make their way into the digestive system. 
Simply add half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to your chicken feed as a natural way to deworm them.
<li>3. Oregano</li>
The essential oil of Oregano is a natural antibiotic.
Oregano can be given to ducks and chickens in the form of an essential oil, fresh or dried. 
It can help prevent coccidiosis, blackhead, E.coli, avian flu, and bronchitis.
You can add dried oregano to feed or water or simply sprinkle them in the brooder or coop as a free choice snack. 
Add extra oregano to the diet of laying hens to give them an added immune system booster.
<li>4. Cinnamon</li>
Cinnamon reduces inflammation and boasts of anti-infectious, antibacterial and antioxidant properties as well. 
It also aids in the prevention of neurological disease. 
A compound in the spice helps enhance blood flow to the feet, wattles, and combs to ward off frostbite. 
It also may help with the prevention of congestion, coughing, infection, and respiratory problems.
<li>5. Turmeric</li>
Turmeric is best known for its powerful antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties. 
If your chickens or ducks get “Bumblefoot” – intense and highly visible swelling of the foot or lower leg, turmeric can likely help.
Chicks that are unable to hold their head up properly can benefit from adding a pinch of turmeric to their feed. 
Turmeric also helps boost a hen’s immunity to fight infection by adding 1/2 teaspoon to their feed.
.
<li>6. Garlic</li>
Garlic not only helps boost the respiratory and immune systems, it also helps to repel ticks, mites, lice and other common parasites who like to claim the members of your flock for their new home. 
It also serves as a natural wormer and may even reduce the stench of manure by adding to the feed on a regular basis. 
You can also float whole cloves in the waterer to administer the spice to your flock. 
Sprinkle a pinch or two of garlic powder over dry feed as a natural health supplement for the flock.
<li>7. Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
Add a teaspoon of the vinegar to the water twice a week during the warm weather months to help *boost calcium absorption*. 
It is known that hens struggle with calcium absorption in the summer far more than any other members of the flock. 
As a result, drop in calcium will likely cause laying issues and negatively impact eggshell hardiness.
<li>8. Ginger</li>
If a member of the flock has lost its appetite, ginger just might do the trick and spark a desire to eat again.
The spice is also often used to help ease an upset stomach, reduce congestion, and as an immune system booster. 
Ginger also boasts strong anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties. 
Add a small pinch of dried ginger to feed or cast inside the chicken or duck habitat as a free choice supplement.
A pinch of dried ginger can also promote the production of *large eggs
